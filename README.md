# ACT: Automated CPS Testing for Open-Source Robotic Platforms

## Abstract: 

Open-source software for cyber-physical systems (CPS) often lacks
robust testing involving robotic platforms, resulting in critical er-
rors that remain undetected. This is especially challenging when
multiple modules of CPS software are developed by various open-
source contributors. To address this gap, we propose Automated
CPS Testing (ACT) that performs automated, continuous testing of
open-source software with its robotic platforms, integrated with
the open-source infrastructure such as GitHub.

## TODO:

Changes in code and more uniformity.
